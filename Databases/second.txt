Vedic Saraswati River originated in the Himalayas and flowed between Indus River in the west and Ganges River in the east through Punjab, Haryana, western Rajasthan and Gujarat.

The performance of the existing irrigation systems (particularly, the Major and Medium irrigation projects) suffer from low water use efficiency, distribution losses, poor operational maintenance and management of soil salinity, water logging and tail end problems. Space-borne multi-spectral data by virtue of synoptic coverage of a fairly large area at regular interval has been found to be very useful in generating information on the status of irrigation commands for objective evaluation and for taking up corrective measures. NRSC carried out performance evaluation of command areas using satellite remote sensing data across several irrigation projects in India. Baseline study of water use efficiency of 10 medium irrigation projects in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh States is conducted by NRSC in collaboration with WALAMTARI with the objectives to assess the irrigated area and irrigation system performance for the projects under consideration for the year 2016- 2017 with satellite inputs coupled with infield measurements. The portal depicts the various elements of the 10 medium irrigation projects under investigation. The various geo-spatial data sets cover administrative, infrastructure, topographic/terrain, thematic, hydrological, irrigation and socio-economic aspects. The portal hosts ground truth data collected by field functionaries. The portal also enables periodic updation of dynamic field data on irrigation canal supplies and reservoir storage.

Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) under the Ministry of Rural Development was conceptualized and launched on 25th December, 2000 as a centrally sponsored scheme, with the broad objective of sustainable poverty reduction in rural areas. The main objective of PMGSY is to provide basic access by way of single all-weather road to all eligible unconnected habitations in the Core Network. Under PMGSY, approx. 6,26,034 km of length has been constructed till 31st March 2020. It is a challenge to manage such a gigantic activity using traditional methods, which is not only tedious and time-consuming but also difficult to ensure timely retrieval of the desired information. To overcome these difficulties, the use of Geo Informatics is taken up to help in effective planning, decision making and monitoring of PMGSY roads.
