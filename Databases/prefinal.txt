Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) of the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR,RD&GR), Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) of Department of Land Resources (DoLR) the On Farm Water Management (OFWM) of Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DACFW). The Programme architecture of PMKSY will be to adopt a ‘decentralized State level planning and projectised execution’ structure that will allow States to draw up their own irrigation development plans based on District Irrigation Plan (DIP) and State Irrigation Plan (SIP). Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (MOAFW) is promoting the efficient water conveyance and precision water application devices like drips, sprinklers, pivots, rain-guns in the farm “(Jal Sinchan)”, construction of micro-irrigation structures to supplement source creation activities, extension activities for promotion of scientific moisture conservation and agronomic measures. PMKSY – Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) – to focus micro level storage structures, efficient water conveyance and application, precision irrigation systems, topping up of input cost beyond MGNREGA permissible limits, secondary storage, water lifting devices, extension activities, co-ordination and management – being implemented by DAC&FW. The PDMC includes the Programme management, preparation of State/District Irrigation Plan, approval of annual action plan, Monitoring etc. The following components of Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) scheme is sub-divided into Micro Irrigation (MI) and Other Interventions(OI), and the assets created are to be geo-tagged using Bhuvan-PDMC app (apk) and uploading to Bhuvan web portal developed by National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) , ISRO, Hyderabad. These assets are classified into \\uf0d8 Promoting efficient water conveyance and precision water application devices like drips, sprinklers(portable, Mini, Micro,semi-permanent) pivots, rain-guns in the fields \\uf0d8 Assets created under MGNREGS for activities like lining inlet, outlet, silt traps, distribution system etc., \\uf0d8 Construction of micro irrigation structures to supplement source creation activities including check dam, farm pond, open wells, tube wells and dug wells. \\uf0d8 Secondary storage structures at tail end of canal system to store water for use during dry periods through effective on-farm water management such as connectivity lifting devices, percolation tanks, ; \\uf0d8 Water lifting devices like diesel/ electric/ solar pump sets including water carriage pipes ( Movable assets to be geo-tagged with Engine/chassis Number) \\uf0d8 Improved/innovative distribution system like piped irrigation channels, pre-cast field channels, lifting devices and box outlet systems etc., \\uf0d8 Extension activities for promotion of scientific moisture conservation and agronomic measures (Current year) \\uf0d8 Capacity building, training for farmers and field staff as well as Awareness campaign, organisation of workshops, conferences etc., (Current year) Login As: Administrator State Moderator District Moderator Discussion-Forum Contact us | Terms " metadata={\'source\': \'https://bhuvan-app1.nrsc.gov.in/pdmc/\', \'title\': "Welcome to Bhuvan | ISRO\'s Geoportal | Gateway to Indian Earth Observation", \'language\': \'No language found.\'}', 'page_content=" ISRO\'s Geoportal | Gateway to Indian Earth Observation | Applications Hot Weather Outlook Login Welcome User En| Hi Tools Navigation Tools My Layers Add Layer Draw Measure Area Measure Distance Get Directions Proximity | Link | Home Select Color Map | Satellite Hybrid Terrain More Base Admin Base Hydrology Field Photographs/Info(FP/FI) Field Photographs/Info(FP/FI) Crop Land Cover & Natural Resources Landslides POI RiverBankErosion FP/FI Cluster Infrastructure (Road & Rail) Infrastructure (Road & Rail) Rediff Maps Survey Of India BhuvanDisclaimer:This is version 1.0 data.

The discovery of the sites of Harappan civilization along the banks of the Saraswati River indicates towards its mighty and magnanimity. Vedic Saraswati River originated in the Himalayas and flowed between Indus River in the west and Ganges River in the east through Punjab, Haryana, western Rajasthan and Gujarat. It is finally drained into Gulf of Kachchh in Arabian Sea. The Vedic Saraswati River disappeared around 5000 BP due to climatic and tectonic changes. It is believed that River Saraswati is still flowing below the Thar desert and its Himalayan connectivity is alive. The relict of this lost river is preserved as palaeochannels under the cover of aeolian sand / alluvium. Saraswati River in Ancient Literatures - The name `Saraswati\' has been used in most of the ancient literatures like Vedas, Manusmriti, Mahabharata and Puranas: 1. Vedas - There are frequent references of River Saraswati in Vedic literature (80 times more than that of River Ganges). No other river has received so much importance and respect as Saraswati. The Vedic hymns are composed by different Rishis (scholars) in the glory of River Saraswati. (a) Rigveda - Vedic Saraswati is described as `Best of Mothers, Best of Rivers, Best of Goddesses`. (b) Yajurveda - Saraswati has five important tributaries viz. Drishadvati, Satudri (Sutlej), Chandrabagha (Chenab), Vipasa (Vyas) and Iravati (Ravi). All these rivers merge to Saraswati to meet Sindhu Sagar (the Arabian Sea). (c) Atharvaveda - God bestowed the people on the bank of the Saraswati, with sweet juicy barley, where generous Maruts became farmers & Indra as the Lord of agriculture. This Mantra suggests that farming of cereals was practiced on the fertile soil of Saraswati during Vedic times. 2. Manusmriti - The land between the Saraswati and Drishadvati is created by God; this land is defined as Brahmavarta. 3. Mahabharata - Mahabharata gives clear geographical accounts of a number of pilgrimage sites spread along the course of the Saraswati River. Lord Balaram after visiting a number of holy places reaches to Vinasana, the place where the Saraswati disappeared. During Mahabharata period, the discharge of water in Saraswati became extremely low. As a result, the river vanished in the desert sand at certain place along its regular course i.e. at Vinasana. Hence, the river channel appeared dry. 4. Purana - Rishi Markandeya, close to the place where he meditated and offered sacrifices saw Saraswati rising from the Plaksha tree (Pipal tree). The sage prayed and worshiped the rising river. Discovering `Lost River Saraswati\' through Remote Sensing Techniques - Discovering the exact course of Vedic Saraswati River and its perennial source is a challenging task among the researchers due to lack of proper scientific database. The mystery is unravelled through modern tools like Remote Sensing and GIS by using multi-spectral and multi-resolution satellite images of optical and microwave data. ISRO centres could able to delineate most of the palaeochannels of Vedic Saraswati River and its linkage with the present day Himalayan Rivers. Linkages of Vedic Saraswati with Himalayan Rivers - (a) Linkage of Saraswati Nadi with Somb River at Adi Badri (b) Linkage of Saraswati Nadi with Yamuna River (c) Linkage of Saraswati Nadi with Vedic Saraswati (d) Linkage of Sutlej Palaeochannel with Vedic Saraswati (e) Linkage of Vedic Saraswati from Mannsarovar to Dwaraka Utility of Palaeochannel Maps - 1. Cultural Heritage: (a) Restoration of Historical sites and (b) Excavation of New Archaeological Sites. 2. Ground Water: (a) Groundwater exploration and (b) Groundwater recharge 3. Tourism Sector: (a) Renovation of temples and (b) Reconstruction of Ritual Sites along the bank of Saraswati River.

The main objective of PMGSY is to provide basic access by way of single all-weather road to all eligible unconnected habitations in the Core Network. Under PMGSY, approx. 6,26,034 km of length has been constructed till 31st March 2020. It is a challenge to manage such a gigantic activity using traditional methods, which is not only tedious and time-consuming but also difficult to ensure timely retrieval of the desired information. To overcome these difficulties, the use of Geo Informatics is taken up to help in effective planning, decision making and monitoring of PMGSY roads. The Tripartite Agreement on Use of Geo Informatics in Rural Road Projects under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) was made and executed at New Delhi on 7th March, 2017 between National Rural Infrastructure Development Agency (NRIDA), National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) and Center for Geo-Informatics Application in Rural Development (CGARD). Under this project National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) and National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD) has jointly taken up to produce geospatial datasets for the country. This project is to extract and identify roads connectivity status in terms of length based on inputs provided by NRIDA. This includes generating a spatial database on road connectivity with respect to habitations connected under completed roads. Hence, it is essential to generate a rural road map based on satellite imagery for the roads sanctioned from the year 2000-01 onwards for further investigation and analysis.

Is the Bhuvan account creation open for all? Ans. Yes, anyone can signup Is high resolution satellite data free for downloading Ans. No, 1 meter high resolution Satellite data is for visualization. Moderate resolution satellite data eg-LISS III, AWIFS is free for downloading. Free Satellite data is processed or raw ? Ans. yes, Geo-referenced and orthorectified Are thematic maps available for download as shape files? Ans. No, But they are available to import to external sources as Web Map Services. Point of information data cab be downloaded? Ans. No, For information only Can we report an error in data set ? Ans.Yes, Please write to us at “email” along with a short description and screenshot. Is There any training program for users ? Ans. Yes, information is available at Bhuvan home page, for more information Write to : Email: bhuvantraining{at} nrsc[dot]gov[dot]in Can I share my Data with Bhuvan ? Ans.Yes, you can share your data, for more information write us to bhuvan[at] nrsc[dot]gov[dot]in What is CartoDEM-1arc Second? Ans.CartoDEM-1 arc second: DEM generated from Cartosat-1 Stereo data having the resolution of one arc-second (approximately 30 meters) What is Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) data? Ans.This data is received from Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) which operates in three spectral bands in VNIR and one band in SWIR with 56 metre spatial resolution and a combined swath of 730 km achieved through two AWiFS cameras. What is Linear Imaging and Self Scanning Sensor (LISS) III data? Ans.This data is received from Linear Imaging and Self Scanning Sensor (LISS) which operates in three spectral bands in VNIR and one band in SWIR with 23.5 metre spatial resolution and a swath of 141 km. What is Vegetation Fraction(VF)? Ans. Vegetation Fraction (VF) is defined as the percentage or fraction of occupation of vegetation canopy in a given ground area in vertical projection. It is a canopy bio-physical property. What is Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)? Ans. Answer is correct but needs to be formatted with proper full-stops. Try to make the equation appear in next line and then continue the sentence after the equation. Like this. “The mathematical equation for area of a circle is, A=πr^2 Where, r is the radius of the circl What is the vertical accuracy of CartDEM? Ans. CartoDEM vertical accuracy is about 8m at 90% confidence. What is the Thematic accuracy of NDVI and VF? Ans. The plot between the NDVI of OCM2 vs. MODIS has given a r-squared value = 0.98. Why is there a limitation on the number of tiles I can download in a day Ans. As per the NRSC open data access policy, the users are allowed to download 20 tiles (10x10) per day for Cartosat1-DEM 20 tiles (10x10) per day for AWiFS and 20 tiles 15\\\'x15\\\' perday for LISS-III for an effective user and bandwidth management at server end. What is backlog? Ans. The user can download 20 tiles of Cartosat1-DEM and 20 tiles of AWiFS data (56m) in a day. If the tiles to be downloaded exceeds the limit, then the user can save his/her search results in "Backlog" list which will enable easy retrieval of search results for further download. This backlog will be available for next 7 days from the time of saving. What is download list? Ans. Download list is an automatic generated list of tiles downloaded by the users. If user has got any technical problem during download, he/she can again download from this list and it is available till 24 hours of data download. This list is provided to facilitate the user to avoid any duplicate download of data How can I locate a place of interest on map? Ans. The place name of interest can be searched through a "Find" utility given in beginning of web page. This utility will accept any place name (text) or value to latitude/longitude and will zoom into map viewer. What is toposheet or mapsheet number? Ans. The toposheet or mapsheet number is an index to identify the geographical area based on Latitude and Longitude of the region. The Mapsheet number used for CartoDEM and AWiFS dissemination are based Open Series Map (OSM) of Survey of India (SOI) for 1:250,000 scale and for LISS III data, it is 1:50,000 scale. What is bounding box? Ans. The bounding box is described by 4 numbers; the x-y coordinates of the lower-left corner of the map, followed by the x-y coordinates of the upper-right corner of the map. What is metadata? Ans. Metadata is defined as "data about data". The metadata describes the definition of data in an adopted standard. The metadata displayed in this portal is based on Indian NSDI (National Spatial Data Infrastructure) standard version 2.0. What is a tile? Ans. Tile is a minimum unit of geographic area that can be downloaded from this portal. The tile numbers are same as mapsheet/toposheet number of SOI. What is the use of Information button? Ans. The information button activates the tooltip option on map viewer. By activating this tool, the user can get toposheet number,bounding box and date of pass (for AWiFS,LISS-III data) on mouse hover on map viewer and to deactivate, use can use navigation button.
